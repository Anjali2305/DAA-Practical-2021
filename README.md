Question -1
Complexity:
Applications:
Red-black trees are needed when height balancing is a desirable trait, and insertion/deletion must not be too slow either. RB trees are common in the Linux kernel. Two of the places where you can see it are:

In the Completely Fair Scheduler implementation - the process virtual runtimes serve as the key.
To keep track of the virtual memory segments for a process - the start address of the range serves as the key.
As you may notice, in both cases it is important to retrieve the node by their key rather quickly from performance considerations.
Question-02

Applications:
-Cluster analysis

-Identify patterns in gene expression
Question-03
Complexity:
Application:
The library has a database that every computer can read from and only the librarian has access to be able to modify the values. This database stores all the information previously made available and adds another value, whether or not the book is available or someone else has it in their possession.

You can now go to the computer and type in the name of the book, the computer will look through the database to find the book in question and then will sort according to whether the book is in stock or not, the location of where it is and how many are available.
